# BacPac
This repository contains the code for the project: "BacPac", which we developed in HackDelft 2018. The purpose of the app is to cut costs for backpackers.
The aim of the app is to recommend a path, given a travel time and budget from the user. At the same time, the app connects together people on the same itinerary.

## Description

What really brings this team together is that we all love travelling, and we’ve done a lot of it. In fact, we’ve just recently returned from a minor abroad in Singapore, which gave us the chance to backpack all around SouthEast Asia together.
The only way we were able to make our dream trips through Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia a reality was by spending countless hours in front of websites expecting us to spend more money than we’d ever seen in our lives for two nights in some torn down bungalow eating expired instant noodles.
That's why we came up with the idea of an app able to optimize the travel route for time and budget constraints given by the user.
